title: "Introduction"
description: "SigNoz is an open-source observability tool that helps you monitor your applications and troubleshoot problems. It provides traces, metrics, and logs under a single pane of glass. It is available both as an [open-source software](https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz) and a [cloud offering](https://signoz.io/teams/)."
---

With SigNoz, you can do the following:

* Visualise Traces, Metrics, and Logs in a single pane of glass
* Monitor application metrics like p99 latency, error rates for your services, external API calls, and individual endpoints.
* Find the root cause of the problem by going to the exact traces which are causing the problem and see detailed flamegraphs of individual request traces.
* Run aggregates on trace data to get business-relevant metrics
* Filter and query logs, build dashboards and alerts based on attributes in logs
* Monitor infrastructure metrics such as CPU utilization or memory usage
* Record exceptions automatically in Python, Java, Ruby, and Javascript
* Easy to set alerts with DIY query builder

## Get Started[](#get-started "Direct link to Get Started")

You can either self-host SigNoz or try SigNoz Cloud. Once SigNoz is up and running, you can instrument your application to send data to SigNoz.

## How Does SigNoz Work?[](#how-does-signoz-work "Direct link to How Does SigNoz Work?")

SigNoz collects data using [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/), an open-source observability solution. OpenTelemetry is backed by Cloud Native Computing Foundation. The project aims to standardize how we instrument our applications for generating telemetry data(traces, metrics, and logs).

 SigNoz supports all the frameworks and languages supported by OpenTelemetry. You can find the complete list of supported languages on the [instrumentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/) page of the OpenTelemetry documentation.

Once you instrument your application with OpenTelemetry, you can send the data to SigNoz for storage, analysis, and visualization.
